        It still lacked a directory or guide to site. Search Engines were the answer, but how they came to be is interesting. </p>

                The search problem  which was how to access information easily and
                could not effectively navigate different sites based on what you were searching for.
                Like having a library that did not have a catalogue.

                The roots of search were found at Stanford, Jerry Yang and David Filo,
                whilst figuring out how to get the most up to date news on basketball. They realized that
                finding this information was hard because there was no directory or guide to using the internet
                and all the websites. They ended up making Jerry and David’s Guide to the Internet.
                This was the early beginnings of Yahoo.

                Advertising in the web community was a taboo topic and had two divided groups. One group that wanted to put ads in the web and
                another group which never wanted ads in the web.

                Yahoo needed a way to make money but were worried about being the first ones to put ads on a website.
                They did not think it could work and might turn away users from using the site Yahoo. Will commercials ruin the internet as they knew it?


                Late 1995 Yahoo took banner ads public on their site.
                Yahoo users was unfazed by the ads and even more and more users came on to the platform, which in turn increased the amount of money yahoo could charge companies for ads.

                In 1996 Yahoo had many competitors; InfoSeek, AltaVista but their toughest challenger was a company called Excite.
                It was similar to Yahoo, but it was much more complex than yahoo’s because it was purely software,
                that would look at your search query and go across to web to find other sites with similar words and bring back the results.

                In 1997 millions of people came online and search sites like yahoo and excite became things called
                “portals” where a user could do many things on one site like chatting or emails or check the news.
                Yahoo and Excite while trying to out innovate each other, deviated from the main objective which
                was search and decided to do anything that kept users coming back by adding unnecessary  features. Thus, making these search engines not very good at searching.

                Stanford Students Larry Page and Sergey Brin met in 1996, Larry had an insight
                which was when searching for something on the web, the site that was visited most when a user searched
                a specific  term usually tended to be the best site relevant to that search query. Hence ranking websites
                based on their relevancy and popularity to the search query allowed more relevant and accurate results to show up for search queries.
                It  later became called Google.

                Google started out of Stanford University,
                and once it released it almost brought Stanford’s Internet down.
                Vinod Khosla, one the co-founders of Sun Microsystems sought for Excite to get a license to Google and team up. However, Excite didn’t want to buy it because they believed it would not be worth it.

                Sergey Brin and Larry Page sought out money and ended up getting a  check on the spot for 100,000 US dollars from Andy Bechtolsheim because he thought it was a great idea for a company. Other angel investors also invested, and they eventually got 1 Million dollars. John Doerr also wrote a check for 12 million dollars, and Michael Moritz who invested in Yahoo matched that amount.

                Bill Gross, cracked the code of internet advertising.
                He realized that search could be an easy way to collect data on users and sell that
                data to companies to better advertise to customers. Google realized that this was the best way to advertise unlike other companies. Google came out with Adwords and highly relevant ads with those highly relevant search results.

                August 19 2004 Google went public, the shares that traded at 100 dollars soared
                to over 700 dollars in 3 years. Google wanted to be different but the same to other companies
                and did not want to be like Microsoft which was very mean to competitors. They diversified
                over the years to become more and more like the portals that Yahoo and Excite used to do.
